# Casino
Just as a note, this is very much a WIP. I assembled the PokerBots and BlackJack sections individually (before I knew I wanted a whole Casino), and Users currently is what houses the maven/MySQL connection. I have not had too much time to integrate this project fully together, nor complete each individual project before I set my eyes on a larger goal. For Poker and Blackjack, they are both simply command line based projects that will eventually be ported over to the website with registered users. Until then, they will sit here. Hopefully, when I have some free time this semester (doubtful), I will be able to at least polish some of these games to look presentable.
