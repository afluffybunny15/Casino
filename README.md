This is a culmination of a couple of solo-projects that I have been working on. It started with just poker because I wanted to make some AI-bots to reinforce some coursework. Then, after replaying Fallout: New Vegas, I realized how much I wanted to play rigged, stake-free blackjack. Then I found I should combine the two and allow for even more!
